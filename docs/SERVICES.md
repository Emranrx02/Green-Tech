# Telemarketing Services — Documentation

Telemarketing: Telemarketing is a direct marketing method where businesses use telephone calls or other telecommunications to promote products or services, generate leads, conduct surveys, or solicit donations.

Typically involves either:

- Outbound calls made by sales representatives to potential customers, or
- Inbound calls received from customers responding to advertisements or promotions.

Telemarketing can be conducted by live agents or through automated systems (robocalls), and it's widely used in both business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) contexts.

If you want this content integrated directly into `src/content/services.js` (so it appears on your `/services` page) I can:

- Replace the current short summaries with the longer documentation, or
- Add a `docs` field to each service in `src/content/services.js` and update `src/pages/Services.jsx` to render the full documentation per-service.

Tell me which integration you prefer and I’ll implement it next.
